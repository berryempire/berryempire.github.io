Berry Empire joined the Cupertino Alliance on September 7th, 2021.
It's obvious that membership in the alliance helped the Empire a lot. And thanks to the WIP Website Project,
the berryempire.cupertinoalliance.ca domain has been granted to the Berry Empire.
The domain is already used to host the governmental website and publish articles.
