<code>November 14th, 2021</code>

<p>Redberry, Emperor of the Berry Empire and the founder of Berry Empire Space &Â Telemetry announced the development of the third Berrian rocket, Cloudberry.
This rocket will use significantly more propellant than Blueberry and Mulberry, therefore it'll allow the rocket to reach new heights and possibly set new records in the micronational community. Researchers would also like to use the rocket to collect precious telemetric data.</p>
