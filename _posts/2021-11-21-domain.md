# Domain provided by the Cupertino Alliance
<code>November 21th, 2021</code>
<br>
<p>Berry Empire joined the Cupertino Alliance on September 7th, 2021.
It's obvious that membership in the alliance helped the Empire a lot. And thanks to the WIP Website Project,
the berryempire.cupertinoalliance.ca domain has been granted to the Berry Empire.
The domain is already used to host the government website.</p>
