## Citizenship
By becoming a citizen of the Berry Empire,
you are allowed to create subterritories and govern them independently.
Alternatively, it is possible to establish an Berrian embassy in your micronation.
Citizens can also observe our aerospace related research.



Note: You can be a citizen of multiple micronations at the same time.
