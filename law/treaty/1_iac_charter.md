== Preamble ==
The member states of the International Aerospace Community (IAC) hereby ratify this Charter in order to establish an international organisation within which organisations within their nation relating to aerospace can cooperate, share knowledge, discuss relevant subjects and consolidate their resources.

== Chapter I: Membership of the IAC ==

=== Section I: State Eligibility ===

# A state may be eligible for membership if the following is true:
## The prospective member state contains an aerospace organisation, such as a space agency, aircraft manufacturer or aerospace research organisation.
## The prospective member state has applied for membership in the IAC through the formal application process (See X).
# Whilst a MicroWiki page for the relevant aerospace organisation is strongly recommended, it shall not be necessary to be eligible for membership.

=== Section II: Entry into the IAC ===

# There shall be two paths of entry into the IAC:
## Membership
### Member-states may vote, be involved within organisational programs and be afforded the duties that are later prescribed within this document.
## Observership
### Observer-states and observer-organisations may not vote or directly participate within organisational programs. They are afforded the duties that are later prescribed within this document.
# In order to enter the IAC as a new member state, a simple majority of current primary members must vote in favour of admitting that member state.
## If a majority of members oppose an application, or those explicitly in favour of admitting a new member state do not constitute a majority, then the prospective member state shall not be admitted.

=== Section III: Individual members ===

# The primary member of a member-state shall generally be responsible for appointing and removing non-primary members of their own member-state.
## The maximum number of members that a member-state may send (The primary member plus all non-primary members) shall be five.
# If a third of all primary members call for a Vote of Removal (VoR) of a primary or non-primary member, the Chairperson must call a vote within 7 days. If the vote succeeds, the individual in question will be removed and must wait 30 days before being allowed to represent a member-state, observer-state or observer-organisation within the IAC.

=== Section IV: Duties of members ===

# Primary members shall have the following responsibilities:
## Voting on applications and organisational matters.
## Representing their nation and organisations in the organisation.
## Ensuring the organisation remains stable and functional.
# Non-primary members shall have the following responsibilities:
## Representing their nation and organisations in the organisation through discussion and activity.
## Ensuring the organisation remains stable and functional.

=== Section V: Observers ===

# Observers shall have the duty of observing the functions of the organisation for the benefit of their observer-state or observer-organisation.
# Observers must be allowed to observe all functions of the organisation, with the exception of specifically staff-related functions.
## For example, Observers should be able to observe application votes. However, they should not be able to observe a staff-specific venue. In general, and observer should be able to see what a non-primary member can see.
## It shall otherwise be at the discretion of the Chairperson as to what specific venues an observer can observe, as long as the Chairperson’s decisions follow the wording of this charter.
# An observer can be a nation (Observer-state) or an international organisation (Observer-organisation).
## Neither are required to represent a national aerospace organisation, unlike member-states.
# An observer-state may send a maximum of three observers at any given time. The observer-state itself shall be responsible for the appointment and removal of these observers.
# An observer-organisation may send a maximum of five observers at any given time. The observer-organisation itself shall be responsible for the appointment and removal of these observers.

=== Section VI: Representation of national organisations ===

# A member-state of the IAC must represent at least one aerospace organisation from their nation.
## There is no limit on the number of national organisations a member-state may represent.
# If a national organisation becomes defunct, and is a member-state’s only represented organisation, the member-state is allowed 30 days to find a new national organisation to represent.

=== Section VII: Removal of member-states ===

# If a third of all primary members call for a Vote of Removal (VoR) of a fellow member-state, the Chairperson must call a vote within 7 days. If such a vote succeeds, the member-state is removed from the organisation, and must wait 30 days before reapplying.
## This shall apply to member-states, not individuals.
## This shall also not apply to national aerospace organisations within member-states.

=== Section VIII: Withdrawal of member-states ===

# If a member-state wishes to withdraw, the primary member must announce as such to the organisation.

=== Section IX: Banning of member-states and individuals ===

# If a third of all primary members call to ban a nation state, organisation or individual, the Chairperson must call a vote within 7 days. If the vote succeeds, the nation state, organisation or individual shall be banned from having any representation within the IAC.
## This shall include being barred from being a primary member, non-primary member or observer for Individuals; being a member-state or observer state for a nation; being represented by any nation for an aerospace organisation; or observing for an international organisation.
# An organisation, nation or individual may be barred regardless of whether they are a participant within the IAC.
# A ban may be lifted at any time after a period of 30 days. If a third of all primary members call for a ban to be lifted, the Chairperson must call a vote within 7 days.
## If the vote succeeds, the ban shall be lifted and the individual, organisation or nation shall be notified by the Chairperson.

== Chapter II: Functions of the organisation ==

=== Section I: The Chairperson ===

# The Chairperson shall have the following responsibilities:
## All responsibilities of primary members.
## Organising votes on applications and organisational matters.
### This shall include calling and ending such votes.
## Representing the organisation overall.
## Moderating the organisation’s discussions.
## Enforcing votes.
## Managing program Administrators.
## Keeping a record of votes and statues.
# The Chairperson shall operate on a rotor system. Every two months, at midnight on the first of the month, a new Chairperson shall take up the position.
## The rotor shall move between primary members in order of the date of entry of their member-state.
## At the end of the rotor, the cycle shall begin again at the beginning.
## Where new members join, they shall be added to the rotor of the next cycle.

=== Section II: The Applications Officer ===

# The Applications Officer shall be responsible handling the application form, and notifying the organisation of any new applicants.
# The Applications Officer shall be appointed by the Chairperson, and confirmed by vote. Both of these must be met for an individual to assume the position.
# The Applications Officer must be either a primary or non-primary member of a member-state.

=== Section III: Voting ===

# All votes shall require a simple majority of all member-states to succeed.
## The only exception to this is the ratification of a new Charter, which shall require a unanimous vote to succeed.
# On all votes, Delegates must be offered three options for which to vote for: Support, Abstain and Oppose.
# Every member-state shall be afforded one vote.
## The primary member of that member-state shall be responsible for voting.
# Votes shall be recorded by the Chairperson.
## These records shall be kept in a designated, online space where all members and non-members alike may access them.
## Applications, statues and miscellaneous votes shall all be recorded separately.
### Ideally, applications and miscellaneous votes should be recorded in similar fashions, whilst statues should be documented more thoroughly.

=== Section IV: Programs ===

# For a program to be created, the Chairperson must bring a vote to the member-states.
# The Chairperson shall be the default Administrator of a program, unless they designate an Administrator for a program.
## The Administrator need not be elected by member-states to assume the position.
## An Administrator must be a primary or non-primary member of a member-state.
## The Chairperson shall be responsible for the appointment and removal of Administrators.
# A program should aim to accomplish a goal, usually within a set time frame, by bringing the organisations of member-states together to cooperate.

=== Section V: Record of Statutes ===

# A statute of the IAC shall be defined as a vote passed by member-states (excluding applications), that  will usually regulate the activities of any individual, nation or organisation represented (ie. participates in any capacity within the organisation, so including both members and observers) within the IAC.
# The Chairperson shall be responsible for recording statutes in a publicly-available fashion.
