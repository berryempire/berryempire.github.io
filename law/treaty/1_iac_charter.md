<ol><li>A state may be eligible for membership if the following is true:
<ol><li>The prospective member state contains an aerospace organisation, such as a space agency, aircraft manufacturer or aerospace research organisation.</li>
<li>The prospective member state has applied for membership in the IAC through the formal application process (See X).</li></ol></li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Section_II:_Entry_into_the_IAC">Section II: Entry into the IAC</span></h3>
<ol><li>There shall be two paths of entry into the IAC:

<ol><li>Member-states may vote, be involved within organisational programs and be afforded the duties that are later prescribed within this document.</li></ol></li>
<li>Observership
<ol><li>Observer-states and observer-organisations may not vote or directly participate within organisational programs. They are afforded the duties that are later prescribed within this document.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
<li>In order to enter the IAC as a new member state, a simple majority of current primary members must vote in favour of admitting that member state.
<ol><li>If a majority of members oppose an application, or those explicitly in favour of admitting a new member state do not constitute a majority, then the prospective member state shall not be admitted.</li></ol></li></ol>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Section_III:_Individual_members">Section III: Individual members</span></h3>
<ol><li>The primary member of a member-state shall generally be responsible for appointing and removing non-primary members of their own member-state.
<ol><li>The maximum number of members that a member-state may send (The primary member plus all non-primary members) shall be five.</li></ol></li>
<li>If a third of all primary members call for a Vote of Removal (VoR) of a primary or non-primary member, the Chairperson must call a vote within 7 days. If the vote succeeds, the individual in question will be removed and must wait 30 days before being allowed to represent a member-state, observer-state or observer-organisation within the IAC.</li></ol>
