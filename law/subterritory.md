## Subterritory governance
Any Berrian citizen can declare their land as subterritory of the Berry Empire.
In this case, the citizen (or governor) governs land indefinitely.

### Law
Each subterritory has to follow all laws ratified by the Berry Empire, but the governor can enrich the laws with their own, territory specific, laws.
Subterritory governors can only sign treaties with allowance of the Emperor.

### Visa, Legal Documents, etc
Citizenship can be obtained online using the official form. But all subterritory governors are required to issue legal documents such as Visa or ID cards to locals.
