## Subterritory governance
Any Berrian citizen can declare their land as subterritory of the Berry Empire.
In this case, the citizen becomes governor of the land.

### Law
Each subterritory has to follow all laws ratified by the Berry Empire, but governors are allowed to enforce additional, local laws unless they violate other Berry Empire laws.
Subterritory governors can sign contracts/treaties, but only on behalf of their subterritories, not the entire empire.

### Visa, Legal Documents, etc
Citizenship can be obtained online using the official form. Subterritory governors can issue legal documents though.
